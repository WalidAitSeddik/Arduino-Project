In this folder, you will find all the tests we performed during our project development. We began by testing each component individually, then gradually grouped and integrated them into two distinct sets.

The first group includes the motion sensor, buzzer, and LEDs — used to detect activity and provide visual and sound feedback.

The second group consists of the 4x4 matrix keypad, LCD, and servo motor, which are used for user interaction and control.

We also attempted to use an RFID module, but it didn’t work due to a defective component.

The final integrated code is saved under the name “Test final”.
